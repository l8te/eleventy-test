## done

- created dummy pages for index, about
- created blog page with post index
- created dummy blog posts
- added moment.js dates
- added excerpt shortcodes
- link back to blog index from post
- prev/next links on post
- defined post layout in json (parent directory data file)
- pagination for blog list

## to do

- tags index
- tags show on post
- tags show under excerpt on blog index
- separate directory/collection for work

## issues
- need to get a better understanding of "{ % extends ... % }" as opposed to layout chaining
