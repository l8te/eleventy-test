## home

Chiba augmented reality systema concrete monofilament neon chrome tank-traps wristwatch sentient-space franchise math-nano-ablative. Apophenia crypto-fluidity sign rebar office tank-traps girl soul-delay chrome media RAF disposable. 

## to do
- permalinks to get url from title, not filename
- separate directory/collection for work (paglist by collection?)
- images from filename in frontmatter
- 404 page
- dynamic "back" link from thoughts/works (currently hardcoded)

## done
- added moment.js dates
- added excerpt shortcodes
- link back to blog index from post
- prev/next links on post
- defined post layout in json (parent directory data file)
- pagination for blog list
- individual tag pages 
- tags show on post
- tags show under excerpt on blog index
- all tag index works
- images with eleventy-img
- moved postslist to partials
- switched from eleventy-img to eleventy-plugin-local-respimg

## issues
- need to get a better understanding of `{ % extends ... % }` as opposed to layout chaining
